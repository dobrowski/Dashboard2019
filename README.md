# Dashboard2019
Repository to explore and compile Dashboard data

Be sure to set up a file structure with a data folder and then subfolders for each years data.  They can be sourced from https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/cm/  on the 'Data Files' tab for 2017 and 2018,  and from https://www3.cde.ca.gov/exfiles/index.aspx?pid=25  with the passwords from AAU for 2019.
